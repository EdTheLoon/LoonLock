# LoonLock
This is a DIY project I am working on that allows me to lock/unlock a door through several methods.
It will utilise an NFC reader and a web server.
Backend coding is done using Google's GoLang.
Frontend is presented through a website interface (for managing keys and remotely locking/unlocking the door).
